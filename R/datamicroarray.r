#' A Collection of Small-Sample, High-Dimensional Microarray Data Sets to Assess
#' Machine Learning Algorithms and Models
#'
#' The R package \code{datamicroarray} provides a collection of small-sample,
#' high-dimensional microarray data sets to assess machine learning algorithms
#' and models. We have also included scripts to download, process, and load the
#' original data sets from their sources.
#'
#' A thorough description and additional information of each data set is provided
#' on the project's wiki at \url{https://github.com/ramey/datamicroarray}.
