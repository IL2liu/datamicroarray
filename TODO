Update the following data sets to the new scheme (see Chiaretti, 2004 for example)
	Alon
	Christensen
	Gravier
	Shipp
	Singh
	Cho et al. (1998) - Yeast Cell Cycle
	Bhattacharjee et al. (2001) - Lung Cancer
	Wen et al. (1998) - Rat CNS
	Yeoh et al. (2002) - St. Jude Leukemia

For 1000 splits, store the training_obs, test_obs, and the the gene ordering with Dudoit's var_sel.
	Alon
	Chiaretti
	Christensen
	Golub
	Gravier
	Khan
	Shipp
	Singh
	Cho et al. (1998) - Yeast Cell Cycle
	Bhattacharjee et al. (2001) - Lung Cancer
	Wen et al. (1998) - Rat CNS
	Yeoh et al. (2002) - St. Jude Leukemia
Create a helper function that returns the splits along with the reduced dimension.
	Takes dataset_name and q.
Add unit test to make sure that q's are specified correctly for each data set.
Also, add unit test to make sure helper function doesn't mess up with other names.
	Example: NULL, "Awesome_data", "Asmodean"

Store data sets with RGoogleStorage (or RAmazonS3) and download them to the end user.
